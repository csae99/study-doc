Azure Networking

# Virtual Network (AWS VPC)

A Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure is a logically isolated network that securely connects Azure resources and extends on-premises networks. 
Key features include:

- Isolation: VNets provide isolation at the network level for segmenting resources and controlling traffic.

- Subnetting: Divide a VNet into subnets for resource organization and traffic control.

- Address Space: VNets have an address space defined using CIDR notation, determining the IP address range.


# Subnets
- Subnets are subdivisions of a Virtual Network, allowing for better organization and traffic management.

# CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

- CIDR notation represents IP addresses and their routing prefix, specifying the range of IP addresses for a network.

# Routes
- Routes dictate how network traffic is directed, specifying the destination and next hop.

# Route Tables
- Route Tables are collections of routes associated with subnets, enabling custom routing rules.

# Network Security Groups (NSGs) 

NSGs are fundamental for Azure's network security, allowing filtering of inbound and outbound traffic. Key aspects include:

- Rules: NSGs define allowed or denied traffic based on source, destination, port, and protocol.

- Default Rules: NSGs have default rules for controlling traffic within the Virtual Network and between subnets.

- Association: NSGs can be associated with subnets or individual network interfaces.

# Application Security Groups (ASGs)

ASGs group Azure virtual machines based on application requirements, simplifying network security:

- Simplification: ASGs allow defining rules based on application roles instead of individual IP addresses.

- Dynamic Membership: ASGs support dynamic membership based on tags or other attributes.

- Rule Association: Security rules can be associated with ASGs for intuitive and scalable network security management.

 1. Core Azure Networking Concepts

1.1 Virtual Network (VNet)

 A VNet is the fundamental building block for private networking in Azure.
 Like a VPC in AWS, it allows Azure resources (VMs, databases, etc.) to communicate securely with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.
 You define:

   IP address space (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`)
   Subnets
   Region (VNets are regional)

---

2. IP Addressing & Subnetting

2.1 Subnets

 Segments of a VNet.
 Each subnet gets a portion of the VNet's IP space (e.g., `/24`, `/26`).
 Resources like VMs and containers are deployed into subnets.

2.2 Public IP Addresses

 Assigned to resources like VMs, load balancers, or NAT gateways.
 Types:

   Basic or Standard
   Dynamic (changes) or Static (fixed)

2.3 Private IP Addresses

 Assigned to resources within the VNet.
 Used for internal communication.

---

3. Routing & Traffic Control

3.1 Route Tables

 Custom routing rules applied to subnets.
 Direct traffic to:

   Network appliances (like firewalls)
   On-premises gateways
   Internet

3.2 System Routes

 Default routes created by Azure:

   E.g., traffic within the VNet, or to the internet.

3.3 User-Defined Routes (UDRs)

 You can override system routes for advanced routing scenarios (e.g., force traffic through a firewall).

---

4. Security Controls

4.1 Network Security Groups (NSGs)

 Stateful packet filtering for:

   Inbound and outbound traffic
 Can be applied at:

   Subnet level
   NIC (Network Interface) level

4.2 Application Security Groups (ASGs)

 Group VMs logically for simplified NSG management.
 You can target ASGs in NSG rules instead of specific IPs.

4.3 Azure Firewall

 A stateful, managed firewall service with:

   Network and application rules
   Threat intelligence
   Logging and diagnostics

4.4 Azure DDoS Protection

 Protects against distributed denial-of-service attacks.
 Two tiers: Basic (free) and Standard (paid, with alerts and tuning).

4.5 Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)

 Protects HTTP/HTTPS apps from OWASP top 10 threats.
 Used with Application Gateway, Front Door, or CDN.

---
5. Hybrid Connectivity

5.1 VPN Gateway

 Establishes secure site-to-site or point-to-site VPNs.
 Connects on-premises networks to Azure VNets.

5.2 Azure ExpressRoute

 Private, high-speed connection to Azure via a colocation provider.
 More secure and reliable than public internet.

5.3 Virtual WAN

 Hub-and-spoke network architecture for large-scale branch and remote user connectivity.

---

6. Connectivity Between VNets

6.1 VNet Peering

 Connects two VNets in the same or different regions.
 Low-latency, high-bandwidth, private connection.
 Peered VNets appear as a single network.

6.2 Global VNet Peering

 Allows VNet peering across different Azure regions.

---

7. Name Resolution (DNS)

7.1 Azure-provided DNS

 Automatic internal DNS resolution for Azure VMs and services.

7.2 Custom DNS Servers

 You can use your own DNS servers, configured per VNet.

7.3 Azure DNS

 Host your own public DNS zones in Azure.
 Integrates with Azure Resource Manager.

8. Load Balancing

8.1 Azure Load Balancer

 Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) load balancing.
 Can be public or internal.
 Basic or Standard SKUs.

8.2 Azure Application Gateway

 Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) load balancer.
 Supports WAF, URL routing, SSL termination.

8.3 Azure Front Door

 Global HTTP/HTTPS load balancer with CDN features.
 Ideal for web apps with global users.

8.4 Traffic Manager

 DNS-based routing to distribute traffic across global endpoints.
 Routing methods: performance, failover, geographic, etc.

---

9. Private Access to Services

9.1 Private Link

 Connects you privately to Azure PaaS (e.g., Azure SQL, Storage) or your own services.
 Avoids public internet.

9.2 Private Endpoint

 A private IP address in your VNet that maps to an Azure service.
 Makes public services available privately.

 Scalable and resilient compared to manually configured NAT instances.

11.2 Azure Bastion

 Provides secure RDP/SSH access to VMs without exposing them via public IPs.

11.3 Network Interface (NIC)

12. Architecture Patterns

12.1 Hub-and-Spoke

 Central hub VNet for shared services (firewall, DNS, etc.).
 Spoke VNets for workloads; peered with hub.

12.2 Mesh

 All VNets peered with each other — complex but direct routing between VNets.

12.3 Virtual WAN

 Scalable, unified hub for connecting branches, VNets, and VPNs.
